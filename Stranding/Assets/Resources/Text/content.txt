// 6 Northern Cross Loop 1
[MultiNotif]The crunching sound suddenly ends. It was the Northern Cross Station. Looking out of the window, a sense of familiarity struck Nella. She decided to go for a walk. There was an empty ticket office beside the exit of the platform. Only a dimming purple light was shinning in the dark. Outside the station, it was a wide river -- almost impossible to see the other side. The water of the river was reflecting the lights from the Northern Cross. She had a feeling that she was the only person that was enjoying the astonishing view right now. ^There were crystals covering the most part of the riverbank. Nella picked one up. A small fire ball was burning inside it, which then flickered, and went out. Nella sat down and started to play with the crystals. Suddenly, her head started to ache, and she heard a girl’s voice. “Nella! Let’s go to the riverbank and play with those sands!” The voice was like a singing oriole. A blurred figure of a blonde girl appeared beside her. The whistle of the train pulled her back to reality. Still trapped in her own thoughts, Nella stumbled for a several times during her trip back to the train.

// 12 Aquila Loop 1
[Choice]The train stopped at Aquila Station. A man with an old-fashioned panama hat went on the train. He scanned through the coach and seemed to make up his mind. “May I sit beside you, lady?” He asked. But Nella’s mind was wandering. The man, however, insisted on a conversation. “My name is Jonah, and I’m a bird hunter.” “A bird hunter?” The line drew Nella’s attention. “Yes! I catch these birds and made them into desserts. In fact, I can give you a box of bird as a gift.” Jonah and pulled out an exquisite candy box with a crystal bird inside. “Have a try!” [Eat the bird-looking candy] Nella thanked Jonah and put one of its legs into her mouth. It tasted sweet and satisfying, like chocolate. “It’s pretty good.” Nella smiled at Jonah, and Jonah replied with a belly laugh. Inside the box, there was a picture showing three enormous trunks of cosmic dust and gases. Nella pointed at it, “Ah, I know this picture. <The pillars of creation>, taken by the Hubble space telescope.” “Bingo! I put this one in the box because it’s my favorite.” “So am I. I just can’t express enough about how I love the Hubble space telescope.” After a transient silence. Jonah suddenly stood up. “I need to go and chase after some birds right now. We might meet in the future if you stay on this train.” “I might, good luck.” Jonah lowered his hat to show his respect, then walked slowly towards the door. [Shake head]The old man went away

[Choice] A man in uniform next to Nella stood up, he seemed terrified, waved his hand for help, and keep mumming “this is not the time, this is not the time, I have to wait, have to wait till a station.” He turned to Nella, pale and desperate, “hold my hand, please, I’m scared” Nella was frightened, she don’t know whether she should stretch out his arm. [Hold the man’s hand] Nella immediately grasped the soldier’s hand, but he caught nothing, on the last moment that man disappear, Nella saw the fire burning forest as the helicopter above dropping napalms. [Refuse] Nella was shocked, she didn’t know what to do, but the next second, the soldier disappear, the last thing Nella saw was a bright flash.

// 18 Scorpion Loop 1
[MultiNotif]Outside the window, stars gathered and formed a scorpion. The space was set ablaze. The train had just arrived at the Scorpio Station. “Do you know why they are burning the sky?” The gentleman sitting in the front seat of Nella suddenly turned around and ask. Nella shook her head. “It’s not just about the stars.” ^Nella was confused by the gentleman’s words. “Ah… I’m sorry. I just want to tell you a story. It will make more sense after you hear it.” Then, the gentleman reached his pocket watch and checked the time. “Maybe not today. If you kept travelling around the railroad, you will meet me again at this station. Maybe next time. See you then!” The gentleman rushed to the door and got off the train. “Weird fella.” Nella said to herself.

// 24 Southern Cross Loop 1
[Choice]Some passengers on the train started to pray, and the train was silence. A woman took out her silver cross and held it in the hand. A boy lowered his head and started to move his lips. Even the slightest sound is amplified by the silence by tenfold. [Pray]Nella tried to follow along and think about the divine, yet nothing comes out of her mind, only the daunting silence and emptiness. [Look outside]It was the Southern Cross station. Many passengers got off the train here and went to heaven. The main building reminded Nella more of a church rather than a normal train station. Nella just sat straight on the seat and looked out of the window. She didn’t want to pray nor want to get off, and the scenery outside was as beautiful as usual.

[MultiNotif]It was the Northern Cross station again. Nella rushed down the train and walked directly towards the riverbank. The blurred figure of the blonde girl appeared again, so did her voice. “Look at the stars!” “It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Do you see that cross in the sky? That is the northern cross.” A girl’s voice appeared. It was Nella’s voice, but much younger. The girl giggled, “You really like stars.” “Yes! Last week, my father showed me a photo by the name <the pillars of creation>. He said that it was taken by some huge thingy in the sky by the name Hubble.” ^”Hubble? Sounds like my uncle”s name.” “Yes, the thingy they built was powerful enough to take photos of stars and cosmic dusts! I wish that I can watch those stars from a closer distance one day. “ “Maybe you can become an astronaut in the future!” The figure of the blonde girl suddenly became clear, and the girl looked directly at Nella through her blue eyes. “Yes! Yes!” It all came back to Nella. “Why did I forget? I was an astronaut, and that’s why I’m not afraid about the space!”

[Choice] This time Nella was wakened by shouting, she saw that a man in uniform step in, with stars on his shoulder and tears on his face. Nella was pretty sure that she doesn’t know the language that man was using, but he somehow can understand it. Economy, liberation, coup, intervention, Nella was not keen on politics, but she feels the pain of a fellow human being. [Approach] Nella went forward, that man draw out his gun immediately and pointed towards Nella, but then, paralysed and put his whole weight on Nella’s shoulder, the shouting turned into weeping. [Stay put] Nella was frozen when she saw the pistol on the man’s leg. She waited for a while, as everyone else. Then, Nella watched the man draw out the firearm, shot the window, and jumped out of the carriage. The train went on going.

// 12 Aquila Loop 2
[MultiNotif]Nella realized that she was walking in the space. The Hubble space globe was in front of her. It didn’t take long for her to recall what she needed to do. The Hubble space globe was broken, and she needed to repair it. She took out some tools from a small bag, and started repairing. The space globe was like the eyes of human civilization. We can only glimpse into the far universe through it. Suddenly, Nella realized that there was a piece of space junk approaching the Hubble space globe. The debris was travelling very fast, and unfortunately, Hubble was on its way. Hubble is not going to survive the clash. The sensing element of mankind is about to be trashed in a single shot. Without any hesitation, Nella jumped out and reached for the space junk. She rolled in the space, and the debris struck her in the back. Hubble was not in its path anymore, but the clash cut clean through Nella’s oxygen supply. Asphyxiation seized her. ^ Nella saw the face of Jonah when she woke up. “You fell asleep.” “I… dreamt about the last few minutes of my life.” “Really? What did you do?” “I… I protected the Hubble space globe.” “You should damn well be proud of it.” Jonah took off his hat and bowed at Nella.

// 18 Scorpion Loop 2
[MultiNotif]The burning lights from the scorpion woke Nella up. Nella felt that somebody was sitting beside her, it was the gentleman who offered to tell Nella a story. “You’re awake! Want to hear the story?” Nella nodded and sat straight. “The story is about a scorpion. A weasel chased after a scorpion in the desert. The scorpion tried to flee but fell into a deep well. As it was drowning, it started to pray. “I ate so many creatures during my life. But there is nothing that can save me right now. Why didn’t I just let the weasel eat me? It must be hungry as well! God please don’t let me die in vain, please make it count.” ^The scorpion then went ablaze. The flame lighted up the darkness. The fire is still burning till this day.” “I like the story” Nella said. The gentleman nodded, “I want to be that scorpion. If you burn your own life with a never-ending flame, you will be remembered and appreciated. Your death isn’t in vain, it has a meaning to it.” The gentleman sighed, “It’s too late to make a choice now. We are dead, and we are talking about things only living beings can do. How ironic is that?”

// 24 Southern Cross Loop 2
[MultiNotif]It was the Southern Cross again. Suddenly, a person tapped on Nella’s shoulder. Nella turned around. It was an old lady. Her hair was all silver, like the lining of a thermometer. Her eyes were milky, and Nella found it hard to look into those eyes. “Why are you not praying, young woman?” “I have my own god.” The old lady smiled, “What kind of god is your god?” “It’s just the god I believe in.” ^”Do you have faith in him? Gods exist because you believe they do.” The next second, Nella froze. A blonde girl with two blue eyes shining like a crystal ran out of the church-like station. She was wearing a white wedding dress, and she opened her arms. “I prayed to him that day, asking for his blessings. I believed him, and he made us the happiest couple that day. My wife...” The girl ran closer and closer to the train. “Her name is Sophia.” Tears slid across Nella’s cheek silently. “…and I’ll never see her again.” The blonde girl disappeared into the thin air.
[Choice]They approached the Coalsack, Nella felt an unstoppable urge to jump off the train, at this exact moment. A warm feeling went all over her.
