Nella opened her eyes. 
The feeling of oxygen depletion in his body stroke her. She choked and breathed heavily. The sweet taste of air calmed her down.
[Nella, Surprised]Am I... On a train?
Nella looked out of the window. The sky was as black as an obsidian ore, but some stars shined and pierced through the darkness to show their existence. 
It didn’t take a long time for Nella to realise that the train was travelling in space.
She was surprised to find that she was not scared by the situation.
Instead, she felt relieved.
[Nella, Calm]Maybe we will be recognised as a star by the people living on the planets.
[Stephen]What kind of stars have a soft and comfortable blue velvet seat?
Nella turned around. There was an old man with a pair of black glasses. 
[Stephen]My name is Stephen. Would you mind if I seat beside you?
[Nella, Surprised]No, not at all!
Nella had a feeling that she knew this old man.
[Nella, Calm]My name is Nella, and I’m a…
Nella suddenly froze. She realised that she couldn’t recall anything except her name. 
[Stephen]It’s possible for that to happen, especially in this train. I'm Stephen, last name is Hawking.
[Nella, Surprised]Aren't you supposed to be dead right now.
[Stephen]That is probably the case, yes.
[Nella, Surprised]Does that mean...
[Stephen]That is probably the case, Nella. I lived a happy life. I did research about things I love, and that is what makes me complete. I’m glad that I spent my last trip with you, Nella. Now, it’s time for me to live another life.
Stephen replied with a smile.
They gazed into the galaxy.
[Stephen]It's beautiful, isn't it?
They arrived at Southern Cross, Stephen stood up, steped outside, and disappeared in dazzling light.
The train moved again.
